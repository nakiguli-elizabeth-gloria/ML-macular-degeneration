# ML-macular-degeneration
-This project focuses on detecting macular degeneration from medical imaging data using machine learning techniques, with the goal of supporting early diagnosis by accurately classifying retinal images to help reduce diagnostic time and improve patient outcomes. 

-It involves analyzing and preprocessing retinal image data, building and training a machine learning model to identify signs of macular degeneration, evaluating model performance, and providing a reproducible pipeline for medical image classification.
